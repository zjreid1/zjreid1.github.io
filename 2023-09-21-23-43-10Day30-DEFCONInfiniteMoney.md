Today I started catching up on old DEFCON talks that I missed at DEFCON31 and the one I've enjoyed the most so far is the "Infinite Money" transit card hack by a team out of [Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JT_lTfK69Q).  In it they describe how they got interested in it, found similar attempts, how other teams had made progress with similar cards, hit multiple brick walls, and had to iterate through multiple pieces of hardware/prototypes/programs in order to get things to work.  

For me it reinforces having to work as a team, trying multiple times for long periods of time, and trying different things by changing one variable at a time until there's some kind of progress.
