Today I went through chapter 1 of Alice and Bob Learn Appsec by Tanya Janca and it was really good! It boiled down the key parts of security from MFA to security by obscurity, and the most important part: Don't trust anything from outside the app.

Overall from my read of Appsec it seems to be SAST, DAST, and keeping up with coding paradigms and security.  All of that seems doable.  I also found some good resources courtesy of reddit including OWASP, SecDim, along with blogs and a few things to read.  Overall, not a bad day.
