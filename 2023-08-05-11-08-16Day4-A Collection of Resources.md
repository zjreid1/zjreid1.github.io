Yesterday and into this morning I watched Rob's recommendation for the Dept Of Energy's YouTube series on different clean energy systems and processes [Energy 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wldZsR7OY&list=PLACD8E92715335CB2). Watching through it it's obvious that SCADA/OT will be at every step of the process from growth, to generation, storage, etc...


### Susttainable Public Transport

- Hybrid Electric
- Zero Emission/Fully Electric w/ Auto recharging stations
- Compressed Natural Gas (cleaner/quieter/predictable cheaper price(s))
- US National Parks are using natural gas and propane fuels


### Clean Energy Mfg


- MFG: Converting Raw materials to end products
- Clean Energy Mfg: Using advanced tech to meet product needs via cheaper processes and stronger/ligher composites
- Advanced battery tech
- New processes and additive manufacturing (3d printing)

### Heavy Duty Vehicle Efficeiency

- 80% of stuff is hauled, but they are 4% of vehicles on the road, but use an inordinate amount of fuel
- Variety of efficiencies via fuel, engine, aerodynamics, tires, lightweight materials
- Even local shipping trucks can be electric or natural gas

### Geotherm Energy

- Dry steam geotherm plant, or flash steam plant, binary cycle plant, all power generators but use it different processes
- Geotherm is being used today and could be more viable in the future

### Wind Power

- Rotor shift/turbine adjusts to be the most efficient
- Can be on land or sea based

### Fuel Cel Tech

- Fuel cell = basic battery which expels H20
- Stackable
- Hydrogen stores the power from another source such as via nat gas, etc...
- Often used as backup power source


### Energy Efficent Commercial Buildings

- 20% of US energy goes to commercial buildings
- Save energy by using a whole building system design and can be up to 70% more efficent via lighting, heat, even blinds/insulated windows, air distribution system, solar systems

### Feedstocks for Biofuels

- Biofuels made from organic matter
- Biofuels can generally replace most biofuels in a sustainable way (up to 1/3rd of current energy use)
- Energy crops such as poplar trees, switch grass, ag waste, can be converted to biofuels
- Have to break down the plants into biofuel


### Marine/Hydrokinetic energy

- Movement of the ocean's wave via kinetic energy
- Enough energy along coasts/rivers can provide a substantial portion
- Generated via bouys/turbines
- Must preserve ocean life, while also existing in harsh conditions

### Hydropower

- Higher elevation to lower elevation via turbines
- Generates ~7% of US power
- Multiple ways of creating power between diversions, impoundment, or stored power
- Dams can be retrofitted/upgraded w/ new tech (only 3% of current dams generate power)

### Alge to Fuels

- Alge-ponds can store oils
- Oil be extracted via breaking down the alge
- B/C alge uses CO2 it reduces CO2 while providing energy products

### Biofuels

- Biomass from crops, trees, and waste products can be turned into fuel
- Can be integrated w/ current fuel systems
- Uses a number of different from Chemical breakdown, thermal breakdown, etc...

### Lumens

- Measure of Brightness (more lumens = more bright)
- Variety of ways including energy saving bulbs, LEDs, etc...

### Electric Vehicles

- LiON batteries, with high efficency 
- Hybrids can switch between Electric and traditional fuel
- Lol at the Tesla in this section

### Energy Efficent Vehicles

- Up to 3% of US energy powers data centers
- S/w to optimize energy usage
- Uses an air exchange system different than typical HVAC

### Daylighting

- Everything from hoods, to electric-chromatic windows help w/ this
- More natural lighting = less heating bill

### Solar PV

- Enough energy from the sun hits the earth every hour to power the world for an entire year

### Wind Turbines

- Repeat of "Wind Power"

### Cool Roofs

- Cool roofs use high reflection materials to reduce roof temp and mitigate the urban heat island and AC use
- Green roof uses a soil system on the roof to grow plants and reduce energy usage


### Geothermal Heat Energy

- Geothermal heat pumps use a series of pipes, pumps, and water/water and antifreeze mix underground to keep things cool/warm
- Can be used almost anywhere and be vertical or horizontal system

### Home Energy Assessment

- Looking to find where the house can be more efficient and save money/energy

### Concentrating Solar Power

- Reflecting the PVs to make steam and generate electricity
- Uses troughs, mirrors, and other systems

### Fission vs Fusion

- Fission: Splits, U/PU, currently in energy production
- Fusion: Joins, H, still a work in progress

### Small Modular Reactors

- Nuclear can provide reliable energy 
- Smaller and less expensive than traditional nuclear power plants
