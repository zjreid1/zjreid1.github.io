Ironwood Cyber did a CTF on July 20th 2023 to get one of their delightful badges.  The CTF consisted of 4 steps/challenges across various areas.  Overall it was a fun CTF with a GREAT pivot after some of the infrastructure went down.

### Challenge 1: Stenography

After popping into IWC's Discord, they provided an image in their events channel and it was off to the races!  With running $`strings` on the provided file, it came back with a bunch of gibberish

I opted to throw all of the text into a file using $`strings IWC.jpg > IWC.txt` to see if that made it more readable, which it did!

The output showed some HTML, so I opted to change the filetype from .txt to .html and see what that resulted in. Luckily it came out with a bunch of gibberish and some URLs at the top, one of which turned out to be a Rickroll :) and the other led to a hint on what to use for a password with the image.

From here I was a tad lost, so I googled around a bit for stenography sites to use
