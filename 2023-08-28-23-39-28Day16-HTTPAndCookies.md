For day 16 I covered HTTP status coded as well as cookies and key/value pairs to get out different results.  Its also been fun learning different SAST/DAST/IAST tools along with getting to know the ins/outs of DevSecOps and AppSec with one generally focusing more on cloud/deployment and the other more focusing on traditional SWE design patterns, etc...
