1.  Completed Try Hack Me room on basic Network services

- Looked into misconfigs, reverse shells, and bruteforcing techniques

2.  Looked into disinfo techniques and how they play out

I think that the techniques shown in this CGTN TV news program are an incredible look into disinfo techniques and presentation:

[The Point: China slashes UK's interference in Hong Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUtOjDf1iyY)

For context in 2019 and 2020 there were protests in Hong Kong regarding a new law being proposed that would allow for extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland.  This change was being protested due to the fact that it was an encroachment on the Hong Kong legal system and Hong Kong independence that had been enjoyed under "One Country Two Systems" since the UK handed ceded control to China in 1997.  More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests#Mainland_China_reactions)

Parts that are notable here:

1.  The production value: There are clear sets with good lighting, graphics, sound, and direction that makes it all run together seamlessly

2.  Everyone speaks English: This is clearly meant for an audience outside of China

The interesting part here, is that the conversation is COMPLETELY one sided.  None of the hosts acknowledge the central issue or even directly call it out, they all frame the protestors as being unreasonable or how/why China benefits Hong Kong and why the UK is wrong to interfere.  There's an entire 30 minute discussion and it's all about how/why China should be aggrieved or why the protestors are bad it's an incredible piece of work that shows how insidious propaganda can be and operate.
