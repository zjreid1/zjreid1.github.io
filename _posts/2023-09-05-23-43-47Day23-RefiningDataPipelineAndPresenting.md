Today I worked on further refining the data pipeline for the app I want to ulimately create, there's soooo many different edge cases and things that can go wrong when you expect data or the call to be one way, but it comes back different than initially expected.  I also started working on a presentation for SecKC covering the time I spent at DEFCON and am looking forward to getting to see the crew again.
