Started learning about C2 today because I've found C2s interesting for a while now and wanted to get a better grasp on them.  Understanding the vocabulary and process of a C2 makes more sense now and one of the projects I want to do in the long term is creating a basic C2 for a few windows XP VMs.  While the THM C2 module wasn't as clear as it could have been its been fun understanding the difference between payloads, beacons, agents, etc... and seeing the interaction between all of them.
