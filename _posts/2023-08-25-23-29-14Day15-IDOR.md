Spent today on THM learning about IDOR or Insecure Direct Object References, which is just a fancy way of saying "users can input an identifier into the URL and see information they shouldn't have access to".  I remember trying to play around with stuff like that when I was younger, but never knew the technical term for it and I would have thought it would be a solved issue by now, but apparently not!
