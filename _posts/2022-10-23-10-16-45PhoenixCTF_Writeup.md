Had a blast at the [PhoenixCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1778/) and learned some valuable lessons from it.  


Ayyyyyy, made it in the top 20!


Some takeaways from scoreboard leaders:

1.  Failure is part of the game (all top 3 teams had 30+ fails)
2. Go for the easy/numerous stuff first
3. Work with a team, you can do it individually, but it's a harder hill to climb


Personal Takeaways

- I like the challenge of Reversing
- Have a VM setup with the tools you want/need and be prepared to revert it
- Document your challenges, and do regular backups of the documentation that you have

Tools I want to get better with:

- Radare2
- Ghidra
- GDB
