So today I started reading Alice and Bob Learn Application Security by Tanya Janca with the most important lesson being: don't trust anything outside of your own application.  The reason for the pivot is twofold: 1. With where I'm at in my career this is a natural segue into security. 2. With where infosec is right now, as much as I love PLC/ICS cyber stuff it's a much more niche field to break into so it's a much longer road for me.

But, overall I'm finding that I'm enjoying Alice and Bob Learn Application Security as it's very approachable and kind quite frankly.  I've also got a couple other projects on my plate and I need to find a better way to organize all of them, so I'm probably going to resort to a JIRA board at this point to be honest.
