After taking some time away I read Alice and Bob Learn AppSec Chapter 4 and delved deeper into AuthZ and AuthN along with continued reinforcement of input validation, paramaterizing strings, session management, and validating inputs.  Along with all of these comes choices about how to use or leverage different languages, frameworks, identity management solutions, and the support for all of these different things working together.  It was also fun seeing "Smashing the Stack for fun and Profit" pop up when discussing bounds checking/type checking.
