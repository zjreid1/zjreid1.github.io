Started out today with Chapter 2 of Alice and Bob Learn Appsec, and got about halfway through before my brain just wanted to stop reading and wouldn't retain an additional information, so I switched tacs and started down Try Hack Me's Web Application Security track.  I'm a big fan of THM since they have digestable bite-sized modules with clear information, sometimes things can be out of date but even with that it's FAR better than most other platforms/systems.

But covering everything from DNS, to dev tools, to inputs, and frameworks all of it gave good insight into the different ways into web apps and weird things that can happen and why you shouldn't trust inputs or various ways that data is transported.
