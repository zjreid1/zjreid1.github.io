Today was spent learning about data engineering and big data and taking notes on things like volume, velocity, and variety (and possibly veracity depending) as well distributed (horizontal) versus monolithic (vertical) systems.  Additionally did some SQL work on SQL Bolt but need some more SQL resources, because yes W3 Schools is OK, but there are definitely better/more interactive resources out there.
