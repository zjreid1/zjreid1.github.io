For day 19 I saw [this](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/The+low+low+cost+of+committing+cybercrime/30176) article on the cost of committing cybercrime pop up on Hacker News.  As such I started digging into the ideas of imposing costs in order to potentially deter cybercrime.  The initial article that stood out for me was from [lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/cost-imposition-point-understanding-us-cyber-operations-and-strategy-behind-achieving-effects) which introduced me to a number of new concepts including persistent engagement versus forward defense and the costs/tradeoffs associated with them.
